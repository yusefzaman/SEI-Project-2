### **_Description_**

#### TThe app we are proposing aims to bring together independent local businesses and buyers who want to support them. The intuitive design will allow the user to view items each sellers virtual storefront, where they can then click in to each to view the list of items and then in to each item to view details on the item and price.

#### If the user is happy with the item they can then add it to their basket where they can then generate an order to purchase the item. The user is also able to leave reviews on the quality and value of the item - for other users to see.
